# How to identify specimens?

## Traditional Identification

Identification of most animals is fairly straightforward if a good field guide
is available.  Unfortunately, most groups, especially in the ocean, lack field
guides.  One of our goals is to bring together information to develop an online
guide to Florida’s coastal marine life.  Some groups of organisms are fairly
easy to identify; others are more difficult. Below is a broad overview of taxa
into three levels of difficulty.  Those in the first level are relatively easy
to work with, so should be the focus for beginners.  Those at the second level
are more challenging, and those at the third level are only accessible to
professionals.  This is an oversimplification, however, as in each group there
may be some species that are very easy to identify (think brown pelican) and
others that are much more difficult (think winter form of female warbler).

### Level 1: Relatively easy identification, good identification resources available in print or online, with a fair community of naturalists to give species level advice

- **Algae:** larger macroalgae
- **Vascular plants:** all: sea grasses, mangroves, marsh plants
- **Cnidarians:** corals, anemones, large jellyfish
- **Mollusks:** all
- **Arthropods:** decapod crustaceans (crabs, hermits, lobsters, shrimp), stomatopods
- **Echinoderms:** whole phylum
- **Chordates:** vertebrates

### Level 2: Moderately difficult identification, often requires microscopic  examination, less synthetic literature, small community of naturalists to  give advice.

- **Algae:** smaller species
- **Sponges:** larger species
- **Cnidarians:** hydrozoans, smaller jellyfish
- **Cteneophores:** Comb jellies
- **Flatworms:** polyclads
- **Sipunculan worms**
- **Annelids:** polychaetes
- **Arthropods:** peracarid crustaceans (amphipods, isopods, cumaceans, mysids), barnacles
- **Chordates:** sea squirts, lancelets

### Level 3:  Realm of professionals and hardcore amateurs – other taxa not mentioned above.

## Social Media as a Tool to Identify Marine Organisms

Here we introduce the online community natural history platform [iNaturalist](http://inaturalist.org).
